Gmail API makes life easy:  
https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/

Our Gmail account:  
username: entr550.annarbor.tennis@gmail.com  
password: *************  
(I will tell you the password in person.)

By running the match_finder.py code, it will automatically check the email above in specific intervals, tries o find matches, and sends emails to the matches it finds.

When you run the code for the first time, you need to provide credentials that you are allowed to access the gmail account above. The code will attempt to open a new window or tab in your default browser. If you are not already logged into this Google account, you will be prompted to log in.
